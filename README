Our heuristic is a weighted combination of 3 heuristics: pawn count, flag y and mobility. Pawn count is the count of friendly pawns. Flag y is the y coordinate of friendly flag, from 0 to 5, where 0 is the starting position and 5 is the enemy's end of the board. Mobility is the number of possible moves that the player can make at from this state of the game.
The weights for each part of the heuristic were determined experimentally. 4 for pawn count, 3 for flag y and 3 for mobility.
The heuristic also automatically gives a very positive score (100000) and a very large negative score (-100000) to win or lose states.
